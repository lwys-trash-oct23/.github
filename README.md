# So what the heck is this?

Uhh idk.

## Current Projects

This right now, for organization purposes, will host artifacts of my attempt to build LineageOS 18.1 for SM-A5000.
That is, if I get it done. Well, srkndenis has [made a build already back in 2021](https://mega.nz/folder/7s0CnQpL#OpPDOEsGA5APizajXRZ32A/folder/bp0kxYCQ),
it's just that I want to try building from slightly newer code and work around some bugs somehow.
