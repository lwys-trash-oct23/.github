# So what the heck do you do here?

Uhh... IDK.

## Current Projects

This right now, for organization purposes, will host artifacts of my attempt to build LineageOS 18.1 for SM-A5000.
Well, srkndenis has [made a build of 18.1 already back in 2021](https://mega.nz/folder/7s0CnQpL#OpPDOEsGA5APizajXRZ32A/folder/bp0kxYCQ)
and it already works pretty well, it's just that I want to try building *that*.

Work has been done for 20 bring-up before, but I have already given up, because the kernel is too old for A12+ I don't want to deal with it.
