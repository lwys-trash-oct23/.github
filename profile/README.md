# So what the heck do you do here?

Uhh... IDK.

## Current Projects

This right now, for organization purposes, will host artifacts of my attempt to build LineageOS 18.1 for SM-A5000.
Well, srkndenis has made [builds of 18.1 already](https://mega.nz/folder/7s0CnQpL#OpPDOEsGA5APizajXRZ32A/folder/bp0kxYCQ) back in 2021
and it already works pretty well, it's just that I want to try building the OS myself so that I can get security updates.

20.0 bring-up has been worked on as well, but I am currently bottlenecked by the ancient kernel which A12+ won't like
and I can't think of how to deal with it. However, @Hassan-kareem [told me](https://github.com/lwys-trash-oct23/local_manifests/issues/1)
that [`vknecht/msm8916-mainline-linux`](https://github.com/vknecht/msm8916-mainline-linux/tree/aosp/v6.6-msm8916) is a thing, and I'm
thinking about it right now.
Currently 18.1 has again become my primary aim, kindly use the lineage-18.1 local manifest for now.

TWRP building has also been implemented for 18.1, but the resulting image is too large for a5ltechn so I can't test it.
