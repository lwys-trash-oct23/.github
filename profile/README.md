# So what the heck do you do here?

Uhh... IDK.

## Current Projects

This right now, for organization purposes, will host artifacts of my attempt to build LineageOS 20.0 for SM-A5000.
Even though its support for MSM8916 is long gone.
That is if I get it done.
Well, srkndenis has [made a build already back in 2021](https://mega.nz/folder/7s0CnQpL#OpPDOEsGA5APizajXRZ32A/folder/bp0kxYCQ)
and it already works pretty well, it's just that I want to try building from slightly newer code,
and work around some bugs somehow.
